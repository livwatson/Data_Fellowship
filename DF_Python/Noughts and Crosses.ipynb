    "There are several different areas in Machine Learning. One of these is <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is often not as relevant to data science as the other main areas of ML, so we do not cover any reinforcement learning in our curriculum. This notebook is an introduction to the idea of reinforcement learning and a coding challenge as a stretch exercise for people confident in their Python skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a brief introduction, and the inspiration for this notebook, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU\">this video</a>. I strongly recommend you watch that video as well as reading this introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "    Reinforcement learning: what's the big idea?\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is an approach to machine learning based on the way humans (and other animals) learn how to act in the world. When we take an action (e.g., eating some chocolate, or touching a hot stove) we receive a <em>reward</em> (such as a pleasant taste) or a <em>punishment</em> (such as a painful burn). Over time, we learn to repeat the actions which have tended to lead to rewards, and avoid the actions which lead to punishments. So reinforcement learning is about giving a computer program the ability to choose actions, giving it consistent rewards or punishments for those actions, and then training it over time to seek rewards and avoid punishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "An area where this is particularly applicable is in <em>competitive games</em>, and reinforcement learning programs have become extremely successful at playing complex strategy games. In 2016, a system called AlphaGo, developed by Google using reinforcement learning techniques, played five games against Lee Sedol, one of the world's top players of the ancient strategy game Go. AlphaGo won 4 out of the 5 games - the first time a computer beat a world-class Go player without a handicap. Since then, Google have refined their techniques, and their newer AlphaGo Zero beat the earlier AlphaGo by 100 games to 0. There is a free documentary about AlphaGo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go is a complicated game, so we will use a simpler example to introduce reinforcement learning: Noughts-and-crosses (aka Tic-Tac-Toe). In case anyone isn't familiar with this game, a brief summary:\n",
    "Noughts-and-crosses is played on a 3x3 square grid. The two players each have a symbol (O for noughts, X for crosses). The players take turns to draw their symbol into one of the empty cells on the grid. If one player gets \"three in a row\" of their symbol - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - that player wins and the game ends. As their are only 9 cells, after 9 moves, their will be no empty cells left; if this happens and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "    How does reinforcement learning actually work?\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "The setup for a reinforcement learning is as follows. There is an <em>environment</em> which can be in a number of different <em>states</em>. For instance, in noughts-and-crosses, the environment is the board and the state of the environment is which cells have noughts in, which have crosses in, and which are still empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each state, the <em>player</em> has a choice of <em>actions</em>. The environment then changes to a new state (or maybe the same one again, in some games) in response to the action. The way the environment changes might depend on factors outside the player's control, as well as the action chosen. For instance, in noughts-and-crosses, when I make a move I know exactly what state the board will be in after my move, but then the other player takes a turn, and I cannot control that. So the state when I next get to take an action depends partly on the previous actions I took, but also on factors outside my control.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, the player is given <em>feedback</em>. This can happen after every action, or after several actions. The feedback can be positive (a reward), or negative (a punishment), and can have different strengths. It can also be neutral. In noughts-and-crosses, the most obvious way to do it is to give feedback at the end of each game (rather than after each turn), and to give positive feedback for a win, negative feedback for a defeat, and neutral feedback for a draw. You could always give the same \"strength\" of positive or negative feedback, or you could give stronger feedback the quicker the game ended, so that winning quickly has a bigger reward than winning slowly, and losing quickly has a bigger punishment than losing slowly. Other games with more complicated rules might have more complicated systems of feedback; e.g., in chess, winning the game should carry the highest reward, but capturing a piece might also have a small reward (maybe depending on the value of the piece).\n",
    "\n",
    "After receiving feedback, the player adjusts their strategies (the <em>learning phase</em>) so that, in future, if it is faced with a state it has seen before, it is more likely to repeat an action that led to a reward in the past, and less likely to repeat an action that led to punishment. This can be done by coding probabilities for each possible action in each possible state, and then adjusting those probabilities up or down based on the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "    This notebook\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to develop your Python skills by getting you to code a reinforcement learning algorithm for noughts-and-crosses from scratch. You are provided with two Python classes, NoughtsCrosses, and NoughtsCrossesMatch, as well as an outline for a third class, NoughtsCrossesPlayer. You should attempt to complete the NoughtsCrossesPlayer class to create a program that can play noughts-and-crosses and learn from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start by running the first code cells to set up the NoughtsCrosses class. Then there is an explanation of how to use this with example code. Then there is the NoughtsCrossesMatch code cell, which you should run, and explanation and examples. Then you are given code to randomly select from several options with specified probabilities, as this will be useful for coding your player. Then you are given the NoughtsCrossesPlayer class to complete. Finally, there is a \"tournament\" cell which will pit two copies of your player against each other for several rounds and track the results. In noughts-and-crosses, if both players have perfect play, the game always ends in a draw, so this should eventually be the outcome of the tournament, after enough rounds have been played for the players to evolve perfect play."

The forfeiture strings are 'F O' if the noughts played forfeited, 'F X' if the crosses player forfeited, 'F both' if both have forfeited (this occurs if one player forfeits and then the other raises an error while the forfeit is processing, it should never happen in practice) and then the reason for the forfeiture.
