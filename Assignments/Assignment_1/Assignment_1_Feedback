Assignment 1 Feedback
Part 1:
What Went Well:
-	Clear summary of context and key actions.
-	Sensible benchmarking (comparison of outcomes with betting outlets, rather than just raw results).
Even Better If:
-	Any time you include a figure, explain what it shows both with a caption and by referring to it in the main text - the analysis section in particular consisted almost entirely of unexplained graphs.
-	Explicitly quantify your results: "in general it was slightly better" - how much better? How much money would I expect to win using your model against the bookies, for instance?

Part 2:
What Went Well:
-	Project brief sells the benefits of the project well
-	Sensible breakdown of key steps (the "Use cases" - though this is a way of using that term I've never seen before; perhaps it's a DXC-specific use of the phrase?)
-	Considered challenges, esp. GDPR and lockdown constraints
Even Better If:
-	Use more confident language in the email: compare "something I think would be worth exploring..." from the email with "This Social Engagement App will help to provide a smooth transition to Virtual First" (emphasis mine) from the brief itself. The brief is much more confident and positive, but the email is the first thing a sponsor would read, so you want to really sell them on the benefits of the project right from the start.
-	What will success look like? When the project is complete, what will you measure and what standards will you set for assessing the results of the project?
-	Give your sources: "data is showing that young professionals (a few older) are not even considering applying to work at DXC due to it having gone Virtual First" needs a reference
